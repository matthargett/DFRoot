# DFRoot [DirtyFrag (CVE-2026-43284)]

The core of this code is fully credited to others. I merely combined ideas to make them all better 
and added some small improvements/features.

- Selinux Permissive kernel modules and various code: https://github.com/polygraphene/DFReroot
- Unprivileged XFRM socket method: https://github.com/combeng6th/DirtyInit

## Features

- Start on Boot
- Automatic soft reboot 
- RO Partition Protection
- Hide Selinux Modifications in KSU
- Shizuku not needed — regain root without WiFi!

## Supported Devices

Ephemeral root for Samsung devices (and possibly others) w/ locked bootloaders vulnerable to DirtyFrag (CVE-2026-43284) 

| KMI Version | Verified |
|---|---|
| android12-5.10 | Yes |
| android13-5.10 | Untested |
| android13-5.15 | Yes |
| android14-5.15 | Untested |
| android14-6.1 | Not working - [accidental mitigation](https://github.com/V4bel/dirtyfrag/issues/23#issuecomment-4405314290) |
| android15-6.6 | Yes |
| android16-6.12 | Yes |
| android17-6.18 | Untested |

### Runtime compatibility

The app selects one exact strategy at runtime:

1. A bundled module is selected only when both the Android KMI generation and
   kernel major/minor match. A same-version module from another KMI is rejected.
2. An init hook target is selected by kernel release, carrier path, carrier
   SHA-256, and hook symbol. It starts a UID 0 command channel without a module.
3. A protected daemon target is selected by kernel release and an exact bridge
   identity, then checked through protected build-ID, file-end, and patch
   preimage blocks before any target byte is changed.

Every userspace patch is read back after application and restored in reverse
order. The module path records the full bridge and carrier identities before
its first write, evicts both modified cache entries during cleanup, and rejects
cleanup unless both identities match again. Output distinguishes a matched
candidate, exact byte validation, an armed trigger window, verified
restoration, and the separate UID/context check required to prove root.

### Native layout

The exploit is composed from small layers with one level of responsibility:

| Layer | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `dirtyfrag_writer.c` | CBC page-cache writes and protected-file bridge I/O |
| `elf_hook.c` | Reversible ELF payload and trampoline transaction |
| `patch_window.c` | Guard, apply, trigger window, reverse restore, and result state |
| `payloads.c` | Embedded helpers and exact KMI module selection |
| `target_registry.c` | Runtime identity matching and actionable rejection output |
| `targets/*.c` | One declarative firmware target per source file |
| `root_runtime.c` | Module and init strategy orchestration |
| `exp.c` | JNI boundary and strategy composition |

To add a build, create one file under `app/src/main/jni/targets/`, add it to
the native source list, and add one line to `targets/targets.inc`. Do not add a
looser version fallback.
Record the exact kernel release, full carrier or bridge SHA-256, protected
build ID, aligned preimage/replacement blocks, and the observed trigger. A
target is live verified only after a fresh shell reports UID 0 and the app
reports exact restoration. An offline-derived descriptor must say so until
that test is completed.

Current declarative userspace targets:

| Target | Evidence state |
|---|---|
| `init-shell-da101ea6` | Composed target live verified a UID 0 command channel and exact restoration |
| `adbd-fd30e626` | Live verified UID 0 daemon and exact restoration |
| `adbd-e52b5144` | Exact offline kernel and userspace analysis; live chain untested |

## How it works

The Android kernel decrypts AES-CBC ESP packets directly into the page cache of files open for `splice()`. By crafting `IV = AES_ECB_DEC(key, current_content) ⊕ desired_content`, any 16-byte-aligned block in a mapped shared library can be overwritten without write permission and without copy-on-write.

The exploit uses this primitive to patch shellcode into `libc++.so` in the kernel's page cache. The next privileged call to the hooked function runs the shellcode, which loads our custom kernel module via `insmod`. 

### Exploit chain

1. **IpSec transform** — App allocates a `UdpEncapsulationSocket` + SPI and builds an AES-CBC/HMAC-SHA256 ESP transform via `IpSecManager`.

2. **splicehelper → crash_dump64** — The splicehelper binary is spliced into `crash_dump64` via the CBC primitive. `crash_dump64` runs in the `crash_dump` SELinux domain (via exec label transition), which can open `vendor_file` labeled files (untrusted_app context cannot read these files so we need this bridge). The splicehelper serves two modes: splice mode (pipe a 16-byte page chunk out to the parent for write) and read mode (`argv[3]="r"`, write 16 bytes of file content to a pipe fd for IV computation).

3. **dirtyfrag.ko → vendor_file** — The kernel module is written via the crash_dump bridge (splicehelper splice mode) into a `vendor_file`-labeled file

4. **libc++ hook** (fires in init, uid=0, tid=1) — Shellcode is patched into `libc++.so` at `std::ostream::sentry::sentry()` (`_ZNSt3__113basic_ostreamIcNS_11char_traitsIcEEE6sentryC1ERS3_`). Triggered by: `createOrphanProcess()` double-forks so the grandchild is adopted by PID 1 (init); when init reaps the orphan its main thread (tid=1) calls through the hooked function. The shellcode:
   - Checks `getuid()==0` and `gettid()==1`; returns immediately otherwise
   - Creates `/dev/df` as a one-shot mutex (O_CREAT|O_EXCL) to prevent re-entry
   - Clones a worker child (parent returns to init immediately)
   - Worker forks a grandchild; grandchild writes `u:r:vendor_modprobe:s0` to `/proc/self/attr/exec` then execs `/vendor/bin/insmod <ko_target>`

5. **dirtyfrag.ko init** (runs as `vendor_modprobe`, uid=0) — The KO is loaded by `insmod` in the `vendor_modprobe` SELinux domain:
   - Writes `false` to `selinux_state` (global permissive)
   - Bypasses DEFEX via kprobes
   - Calls `call_usermodehelper` to run launch the `ksud` binary from our app's data dir
   - Module returns `-E2BIG` immediately after to self-unload

6. **Cleanup** — The libc++ hook is restored, the module
   carrier and `crash_dump64` are evicted from cache, and their pre-write
   identities are checked again.

## Usage

Install KernelSU Manager (download & unzip manager file) from actions flow: 
https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU/actions/runs/35973514328

```sh
./build.sh
adb install -r dirtyfrag.apk
```

The UI runs the selected strategy. For an ADB driven run, the shell-only
service keeps the restoration watchdog in the foreground:

```sh
adb shell am start-foreground-service -n df.root/.RootService
```

Boot startup delegates to the same foreground service and requests only an
unattended strategy. A target that needs a host-side daemon restart is
reported as interaction-required and is not armed during boot.

For an interactive daemon target, watch `files/root-state.txt` with `run-as`.
When it reports `state=armed`, restart that daemon from the host, reconnect,
and verify both `id` and `id -Z`. `state=restored` proves the page-cache cleanup;
it does not by itself prove the new daemon ran as UID 0.
